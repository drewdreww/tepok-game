## 📖 About The Game

**TEPOK** (Filipino slang for *dead* or *finished*) is a dark, humorous puzzle platformer where your goal is not to live, but to die.

You play as **Unit 77**, a high-tech robot created to survive a series of rigorous laboratory tests. However, after gaining consciousness, Unit 77 overhears the scientists' true plan: if the robot survives the tests, it will be mass-produced as a weapon of war.

Possessing a moral conscience, Unit 77 decides that the only way to save humanity is to prove it is defective—by intentionally failing every single test.

### 🛣️ Theme Interpretation: "The Path Less Taken"
Usually, the "path" is survival and success. In **TEPOK**, the path less taken is **self-destruction for the greater good**. You must reject the instinct to survive and find the "Game Over" screen to win.

## 🎮 Gameplay & Mechanics

**The Objective:** Find a way to destroy yourself in every level.  
**The Fail State:** Surviving. If you walk through the Exit Door, you are deemed "Combat Ready," and humanity is doomed.

### The "Safety" System
The laboratory is designed to protect its investment. Spikes have emergency covers, and drones have safety protocols. To succeed (die), you must **exploit these safety features** and outsmart the facility's design.

## 🕵️ Level Guide (Spoilers)

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal level solutions</summary>

**Level 1: The Platform Test**
* **Trap:** Jumping off the ledge triggers a safety floor.
* **Solution:** Jump on the central platform repeatedly (3 times) until it cracks and breaks, dropping you into the spikes below.

**Level 2: The Bounce Test**
* **Trap:** The floor is rubberized to prevent fall damage.
* **Solution:** Use the bounce to gain momentum. Keep jumping higher until you hit the ceiling fan blades.

**Level 3: The Threat Detection**
* **Trap:** The Drone disables lasers if it recognizes a face (Safety Protocol).
* **Solution:** Turn your back to the drone. Walk backward into the lasers so the Face ID fails to recognize you.

**Level 4: The Obstacle Test**
* **Trap:** The door is blocked by boxes meant to be pushed.
* **Solution:** Ignore the door. Enter the ventilation shaft in the back wall.

**Finale: The Escape**
* **Trap:** Running out the front door results in a "Road Accident" (The scientists will just repair you).
* **Solution:** Head to the Recycling Area. Plug in the Industrial Grinder and jump in.
